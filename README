CPlist Editor is a Cappuccino application designed for editing Property Lists. It is very similar to the Property List Editor.app that is distributed with Apple's Developer Tools, however superior in a few ways. First, you are not required to install anything. Because it is a Cappuccino application, it runs right in your browser. Second, there are a few extra features and UI tweaks. Finally, and most importantly, it is able to read and write the 280North_v1 plist format, which Property List Editor.app cannot. This is extremely helpful for all developers of Cappuccino applications.

This app is still very much a work in progress, and the code at this point is very rudimentary. Follow the commits to keep updated on things that are changing in the app.

To use, just download the repo, drop in your Cappuccino Frameworks folder (or a symlink to $OBJJ_BUILD) to the root directory, and run index.html. You can then either paste the string contents of a plist file into the text area or, if you have BrowserPlus, you can use the Open option to directly import a plist file. If you do not have BrowserPlus installed, it will prompt you upon clicking Open. CPlist Editor is capable of reading and writing the following plist formats: OpenStep Format, XML Format, and 280North Format. When you have finished editing your plist, make sure you have selected the correct format in the toolbar, then click save.
